HTML file is part of a WhatsApp-like chat application. It provides the structure and layout for the user interface of the chat application. The file includes sections for entering a username, displaying the chat interface, and a modal for session expiration messages. It also includes a linked CSS file for styling and a linked JavaScript file for interactivity.

Description:
The HTML file creates the front-end interface for the real-time chat application. It comprises several sections:

Username Section:

A label and input field for entering a username.
A "Set" button to confirm the username.
Chat Section:

Divided into two parts: a sidebar and a main chat area.
Sidebar displays the current user's username.
Main area includes an unordered list (ul) for displaying chat messages.
An input field for typing messages and a "Send" button.
Session Expired Modal:

A modal that displays a message when the session expires.
Contains a close button (&times;) to dismiss the modal.
Linked Files:

The Socket.IO JavaScript library is included using a script tag.
The page is styled using an external CSS file named "style.css".
Interactive behavior is provided by an external JavaScript file named "script.js".
Styling:

The CSS defines the styling for different sections of the chat interface, including colors, sizes, margins, padding, and borders.
The "modal" class is used to create a modal overlay with specified styling, such as colors and gradients.
The "close-button" class styles the close button within the modal.
The "visually-hidden" class hides content visually but makes it available to screen readers for accessibility.
Usage:

Include this HTML code as part of your web application.
Ensure that the linked CSS ("style.css") and JavaScript ("script.js") files are in the same directory as this HTML file.
Customize the styles and behavior as needed for your chat application.
Note:
This HTML file is a crucial component of the WhatsApp-like chat application's user interface. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and server-side code are set up to enable real-time communication between clients.

JavaScript code for the client-side functionality of a WhatsApp-like chat application, as well as a JSON configuration for the project's dependencies. Let's break down the key parts:

Client-Side JavaScript (script.js):

This script manages the interaction and behavior of the chat application on the client side.
It establishes a connection to the Socket.IO server using const socket = io();.
It defines a username variable to store the user's chosen username and an inactivityTimeout variable to handle session expiration.
The checkUsername() function prompts the user to enter a username if one is not set, and it displays the entered username in the UI.
The setUsername() function sets the username and switches the display from the username input section to the chat section.
The sendMessage() function sends a chat message to the server with the user's username and clears the input field. It also sets a timeout to show a session-expired modal after 10 seconds of inactivity.
The socket.on('chat message', ...) block listens for incoming chat messages from the server and displays them in the chat area.
The checkUsernameTimeout() function displays a session-expired modal if a username is not set.
The setUsername() function (again) sets the username, hides the username input section, and shows the chat section. It also saves the username to local storage.
The closeModal() function hides the session-expired modal, resets the username, and displays the username input section.
Package Configuration (package.json):

The provided JSON structure defines the project's metadata and dependencies.
The "dependencies" section lists the required packages for the project: "express", "cors", and "socket.io".
The "devDependencies" section lists "nodemon" as a development dependency. Nodemon is a tool that helps in automatically restarting the server when code changes are detected.
The "scripts" section defines the available scripts. The "start" script uses nodemon to run the server (server.js).
Please note that in the client-side JavaScript code, there is a duplication of the setUsername() function. Make sure to keep only one instance of this function in your code.

This code assumes the presence of a server.js file (not provided) which is expected to be the server-side code responsible for handling incoming and outgoing messages between clients using Socket.IO.

Overall, this code combines both the client-side logic for user interaction and the package configuration for the project's dependencies.



Creating and sending a README file is a common practice when sharing your code with others, especially on platforms like GitHub. A README file provides information about your project, its purpose, how to use it, and other relevant details. Here's how you can create and send a README file:

Create a README File:

Create a new text file in your project directory.
Rename the file to README.md. The .md extension stands for Markdown, a lightweight markup language that's commonly used for creating formatted text.
Edit the README File:

Open the README.md file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or any other code editor).
Write the content of your README using Markdown syntax. Markdown allows you to format text, add headers, lists, links, images, and more.
Include information such as:
Project title and description.
How to install and run the project.
Usage instructions.
Any dependencies or prerequisites.
Troubleshooting tips.
Contact information or links to your GitHub profile.
